### LAN- Local Area Network:

- Spans the geographical area of a small building.
- The most commonly implemented technology is Ethernet, however, it is not limited to only Ethernet Technology.
- The Nodes in a LAN are directly connected to one another by cable or short-range wireless.
- Does not require a line to be leased from a service provider.

### LAN Administrator Duties:

- Broad range of versatile skills is needed.
- Responsible for maintaining and managing the Local Network.
- Should handle tasks like Hardware, software, Deployment, Upgrades, Installation, and Troubleshooting of Network Components.
- Responds to User requirements.

### WAN- Wide Area Network:

- Spans a large Geographical area, and often multiple areas.
- Connects Multiple Local Area Networks together.
- Utilizes long Range Communication such as satellite, or Radiofrequency.
- Can be private, like International Corp., or public. The world‚Äôs largest Public WAN is the **Internet**.

### Types of  WANs:

- PAN - Personal Area Network [ Bluetooth ]
- CAN - Campus Area Network [ School, Colleges ]
- MAN - Metropolitan Area Network [ city ]
- GAN - Global Area Network [ Satellite ]
    - Controlled by One Company
- EN - Enterprise Network
    - An EN is a network that typically is comprised of components of both a WAN and LAN and is owned and operated by a single organization or company.
    

### WAN Administrator Duties:

- Specialized in their respective fields.
    - Need to be fluent in routing structure.
    - Troubleshooting network issues.
    - More responsible for data vs voice system.
- Network-oriented tasks, rather user-oriented tasks. [ Backend ]
- Developing and programming scripts for network task automation.
- Testing and implementing software and hardware upgrades, network-wide.

### Internet

- Used for many things including sending email.
- Completing commercial and private transactions.
- Connecting network in the same room or thousand miles away.
- World uses for communication.
- The world‚Äôs single largest Global - Wide Area Network.

 **`‚úè NOTE: Every bit of data is stored.`**

>Public to everyone.

### Intranet

- An organization‚Äôs private version of the Internet.
- Keeps your network private, or secure from outside sources.
- Same services and protocol as the Internet.
- Accessed the same way you would a web page, through your browser.

> Private Internet.

### Extranet

- A portion of your network that is opened to limited outside sources.
- Helps administrators maintain the rest of your network.
- Allows individuals like vendors to have minimal access.
- An extension of an entity‚Äôs Internet.

> Let other people from other organizations have access to it.

### Segment:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/PradyumnaKumarMirdha/CompTIA-Network-Plus/blob/main/Figures/1.5.%20Network%20Model.png" height="300" weight="200"/>
</p>

**1. Centralized Network**

**2. Client/Server Network**

**3. Peer to Peer Network**

**4. Mixed Mode Network**

> üî¥ The main difference between Centralized and client-server model is that in client-server the processes and resources are allocated wherever they are needed including on client. The client can preform their own processing without constantly talking to the server.

- In centralized model the mainframe will do the processing only whlile the terminal only display what work is going on.
- Peer to peer model is like a work group but the shareing of resources is done manually. If no information are shared between other then, they are no working will be possilbe.
- Combine the functionlities of more than one of the three different networks.

**` ‚úè NOTE: Mixed mode is not used in enterpirse because of lack of control.`**

üî≤ Bus Topology<br>
üî≤ Star Topology<br>
üî≤Ring Topology<br>
üî≤ Tree Topology<br>
üî≤ Mesh Topology<br>

---

### Topology:

- Describes the arrangement or layout of a communication network.
- Lines out the path data communication will take.
- Allows administrators to understand how the devices are connected on the network.
- Two type of Topology: 
	1. Physical Topology
	2. Logical Topology

**`Physical Topology`** -  How the devices are actually connted to one another.
								 Describes the shape of the network takes.
								 Allows the administrators to understand how the physcial media, or cales, connects the devices together.


**`Logical Topology`** - Describes the patway data will take, regardless of the physical connection.
								Allows an administrator to troubleshoot problems with communication in transit by understaning the path data is taking.
								Different than the physical topology of the network.

### Network Connection

#### Point to Point Connections:
- A direct connection between two nodes on a network.

***Example:***

Wireless : Connection through infrared like Remote and TV.
Wired : Connection through NIC or directly through cross over cable.

#### Multipoint Connections:
- Nodes on a ndtwork are connected to two or more nodes simultaneously. Signals are not private in Multipoint connections.
#### Radiated Connections:
- A wireless connection that is either point to point, or Multipoint. Also considered a **Broadcast** connection.

> UNICAST - One recipient

> MULTICAST - Two or more Recipients

> BROADCAST - All Recipients

### Physical Bus Topology:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.hitechmv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bus_network1.gif" height="300" width="400"/>
</p>

> üî¥ When the data is transmitted signal is going to bounce up off the ends  which will **interupt the transmission**. To stop that bounce from occuring Terminators are used (50 ohm).

[Terminator - By David Bombal shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/unBOHR7BjwY)
### Physical Star Topology:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/star-Topology.jpg" height="300" width="400"/>
</p>

- Centralized connection(Switch or Hub).
- Easy to maintain and implement.

> Switch for Unicast & Hub for Broadcast connection.

### Physical Ring Topology:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dual-Ring-Topology.jpg" height="300" width="400"/>
</p>

- Each connected to Upstream and Downstram Neighbors only.
- Traffic is unidirectional only.
- *Dual Ring Topology* is redundant connection.

> Data may take longer time to reach its destination.

### Physical Tree Topology:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220614165620/Untitled7.gif" />
</p>

- It is scalable. 
- Easer to troubleshoot

> If connection is intruputed then none of the child could talk.

**`‚úè NOTE: Higher the branching factor the longer it takes data to travel from one node to another.
`**

### Physical Mesh Topology:

### Network Media:
- The medium used for telecommunication between network devices.
- Network media can be classified according to the hardware and technology associated with it.
- There are both wired and wireless technologies that are associated with network media.

> üî¥ Bounded here is the wired network media.

## Bounded Network Media:
- Actual physical media. Media that can be felt, and seen.
- Copper and fiber optic calbes are example of Bounded Network Media.
-   Utilizes a physical conductor such as metal wire or a glass or plastic core cable.

## **`Copper Media`**

-   Either a single copper core, or made up of twisted pars of copper strands.
    -   These transmits data in the form of electromagnetic energy.
-   Most common implementations are Coaxial(Coax) Cable and Twisted Pair Cable.
-   Foil metal braids helps to prevent EMI(Electro Magnetic Interference).

## **`Twisted Pair Cable`**

-   Two or more pairs of cable twisted together.
-   Color coded wrapped plastic.
-   Pairs are wrapped in another plastic sheath.
-   Will utilize an RJ-45 connector for data.

#### T568/A cable
<p align="center"> <img src="https://images.theengineeringprojects.com/image/webp/2018/07/introduction-to-rj45-4.png.webp?ssl=1" height="300" weight="200"/> </p>

> üî¥ The difference between /A and /B is that the first two pin of T-568A 1 and 2 are swapped with pin 3 and 6. 

### Corssed over ethernet cable

**`IMPORTANT > `**[David Bombal shorts ](https://youtube.com/shorts/XjA-GIS9U5U?feature=share) - Info about cross wired cable on devices.

### STP and UTP cable:
- **Shielded Twisted Pair Cabling** 
	- Copper cabling that has metal foil, or braied sheilding surrounding the paris.
	- Decreases the susceptibility of EMI. 
	- More expensive thatn UTP and can be more difficult to work with. 

- **Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling**
	- UTP does not have any protective metal coating.
	- Very susceptible to EMI.
	- Relatively inexpensive and easy to work with.

### Twisted Pair Cabling Categories:

| Category | Data Rate | Max Length | Application |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| CAT1 | Upto 1 Mbps | | Old Telephone cables. Voice only... Outdated |
| CAT2 | Upto 4 Mbps | | Token Ring, Token based networks only... Outdated |
| Cat3 | 10 Mbps | 100m | Voice Traffic. [TIA/EIA]. Token Ring & 10 Base-T Ethernet |
| CAT4 | 15 Mbps | 100m | Token Ring Networks.Superseded by CAT5. Rarely used today. |
| CAT5 | 100 Mbps | 100m | Fast Ethernet. 100Mhz Frequency.8p8c, RJ45 connector. |
| CAT5e | 1 Gbps | 100m | addressed crosstalk issues. 100Mhz Frequency. |
| CAT6 | 10 Gbps | 100m | Gigabit Ethernet 200-250Mhz. 10Gbps upto 55meter. |
| CAT6a | 10 Gbps | 100m | Augmented CAT6. 500 Mhz. 328 feet. |
| CAT7 | 10 Gbps+ | 100m | 10/100 Base T, GG45, TERA connector. 600Mhz.4 connector. |
| CAT7a | 10 Gbps | 100m | 1/100 Base T. 1000MHz. Additional shielding than cat7. |

#### CAT7  network cable

<p align="center"> <img src="https://stl.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/img4-1.jpg"  height="300" weight="200"/> </p>
Category 7 wire has four shielded twisted copper pairs and an overall cable shield. This helps it meet the strict signal loss over distance criteria and ensures Cat7 cable is better at protecting against possible degradation caused by crosstalk and EMI.

#### Difference between CAT 6 and CAT 7

<p align="center"> <img src="https://www.hdcabling.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CAT5e_vs_CAT6A_vs_CAT7_Differences_in_Construction.jpg" /> </p>
Cat7¬†has a higher frequency than Cat6. As a result, a¬†CAT 7 shielded ethernet cable will be able to transfer data faster than a Cat6 cable.¬†The Cat¬†7 shielded¬†cable¬†performance and longevity criteria are also more stringent.

- Unshielded Twisted pair (UTP)
- Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP) 
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) 
- SFTP (Shielded & Foiled Twisted pair) 
- STP (Screened Shielded Twisted pair)

#### CAT6  variants:

<p align="center"> <img src="https://www.hdcabling.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CAT6_vs_CAT6A_vs_CAT6e_Mhz_Speed_Bandwidth_Diagram-1536x1155.jpg"  height="350"/> </p>

#### CAT 8 cable: 
<p align="center"> <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/tSIAAOSw2Qtc-NHa/s-l1600.jpg"  height="300" weight="200"/> </p>
Category 8, or Cat8, cable, is a type of¬†Ethernet¬†cable¬†that is distinct from other cables. It can operate at a frequency of up to 2 GHz (2000 MHz). This is the main¬†difference between Cat7 and Cat8.¬†Cat 8 ethernet cable¬†is restricted to a 30-meter 2-connector channel. It also necessitates shielded cabling.
