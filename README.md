### Network:

An interconnected or interrelated chain, group, or system.

### Computer Network:

Two or more computers are connected to one another for the purpose of communicating data electronically.

### Components of Network:

1.  Devices
2.  Media
3.  Network Adapter [NIC]
4.  Network Operating System

### Node:

**Any device that is connected to a communications network.

-   Endpoint Node - Clients and server, Printer, and network attached storage Devices.
-   Redistribution Node - Router/Switch/Hub

### Server:

Provides resources and services like addressing 142.168.23.63

Manages devices on the network and control network-wide function like permissions.

### Network Backbone:

It is responsible for carrying the majority of Network traffic.

</p>

-   One backbone cable and multiple switches are connected.
-   Hierarchical/Distributed: Easy management, typical for LANs, Easily scalable.
-   Collapsed: Uses a Router as the connecting point.
-   Parallel: Like collapsed, but uses multiple cable connections. Great for redundancy.

### Terminal:

-   It is a network hardware device that is used to enter data and display data from another computer having computing capabilities.
-   It does not have any processing capabilities or memory of its own.
-   A terminal requires an emulator to run itself.

### Client:

- Has its own resources and memory power.

### Peer:

- It is a network computer that has its own resources and services. It can be both server and client.
- Self Managed and Self Contained.
