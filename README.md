### LAN- Local Area Network:

- Spans the geographical area of a small building.
- The most commonly implemented technology is Ethernet, however, it is not limited to only Ethernet Technology.
- The Nodes in a LAN are directly connected to one another by cable or short-range wireless.
- Does not require a line to be leased from a service provider.

### LAN Administrator Duties:

- Broad range of versatile skills is needed.
- Responsible for maintaining and managing the Local Network.
- Should handle tasks like Hardware, software, Deployment, Upgrades, Installation, and Troubleshooting of Network Components.
- Responds to User requirements.

### WAN- Wide Area Network:

- Spans a large Geographical area, and often multiple areas.
- Connects Multiple Local Area Networks together.
- Utilizes long Range Communication such as satellite, or Radiofrequency.
- Can be private, like International Corp., or public. The world‚Äôs largest Public WAN is the **Internet**.

### Types of  WANs:

- PAN - Personal Area Network [ Bluetooth ]
- CAN - Campus Area Network [ School, Colleges ]
- MAN - Metropolitan Area Network [ city ]
- GAN - Global Area Network [ Satellite ]
    - Controlled by One Company
- EN - Enterprise Network
    - An EN is a network that typically is comprised of components of both a WAN and LAN and is owned and operated by a single organization or company.
    

### WAN Administrator Duties:

- Specialized in their respective fields.
    - Need to be fluent in routing structure.
    - Troubleshooting network issues.
    - More responsible for data vs voice system.
- Network-oriented tasks, rather user-oriented tasks. [ Backend ]
- Developing and programming scripts for network task automation.
- Testing and implementing software and hardware upgrades, network-wide.

### Internet

- Used for many things including sending email.
- Completing commercial and private transactions.
- Connecting network in the same room or thousand miles away.
- World uses for communication.
- The world‚Äôs single largest Global - Wide Area Network.

 **`‚úè NOTE: Every bit of data is stored.`**

>Public to everyone.

### Intranet

- An organization‚Äôs private version of the Internet.
- Keeps your network private, or secure from outside sources.
- Same services and protocol as the Internet.
- Accessed the same way you would a web page, through your browser.

> Private Internet.

### Extranet

- A portion of your network that is opened to limited outside sources.
- Helps administrators maintain the rest of your network.
- Allows individuals like vendors to have minimal access.
- An extension of an entity‚Äôs Internet.

> Let other people from other organizations have access to it.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/PradyumnaKumarMirdha/CompTIA-Network-Plus/blob/main/Figures/1.5.%20Network%20Model.png" height="300" weight="200"/>
</p>

**1. Centralized Network**

**2. Client/Server Network**

**3. Peer to Peer Network**

**4. Mixed Mode Network**

> üî¥ The main difference between Centralized and client-server model is that in client-server the processes and resources are allocated wherever they are needed including on client. The client can preform their own processing without constantly talking to the server.

- In centralized model the mainframe will do the processing only whlile the terminal only display what work is going on.
- Peer to peer model is like a work group but the shareing of resources is done manually. If no information are shared between other then, they are no working will be possilbe.
- Combine the functionlities of more than one of the three different networks.

**` ‚úè NOTE: Mixed mode is not used in enterpirse because of lack of control.`**

### Topology:

- Describes the arrangement or layout of a communication network.
- Lines out the path data communication will take.
- Allows administrators to understand how the devices are connected on the network.
- Two type of Topology: 
	1. Physical Topology
	2. Logical Topology

**`Physical Topology`** -  How the devices are actually connted to one another.
								 Describes the shape of the network takes.
								 Allows the administrators to understand how the physcial media, or cales, connects the devices together.


**`Logical Topology`** - Describes the patway data will take, regardless of the physical connection.
								Allows an administrator to troubleshoot problems with communication in transit by understaning the path data is taking.
								Different than the physical topology of the network.

### Network Connection

#### Point to Point Connections:
- A direct connection between two nodes on a network.

***Example:***

Wireless : Connection through infrared like Remote and TV.
Wired : Connection through NIC or directly through cross over cable.

#### Multipoint Connections:
- Nodes on a ndtwork are connected to two or more nodes simultaneously. Signals are not private in Multipoint connections.
#### Radiated Connections:
- A wireless connection that is either point to point, or Multipoint. Also considered a **Broadcast** connection.

> UNICAST - One recipient

> MULTICAST - Two or more Recipients

> BROADCAST - All Recipients

### Physical Bus Topology:

<p align="center">

### Network Media:
- The medium used for telecommunication between network devices.
- Network media can be classified according to the hardware and technology associated with it.
- There are both wired and wireless technologies that are associated with network media.

> üî¥ Bounded here is the wired network media.

## Bounded Network Media:
- Actual physical media. Media that can be felt, and seen.
- Copper and fiber optic calbes are example of Bounded Network Media.
-   Utilizes a physical conductor such as metal wire or a glass or plastic core cable.

### **`Copper Media`**

-   Either a single copper core, or made up of twisted pars of copper strands.
    -   These transmits data in the form of electromagnetic energy.
-   Most common implementations are Coaxial(Coax) Cable and Twisted Pair Cable.
-   Foil metal braids helps to prevent EMI(Electro Magnetic Interference).

#### **`Twisted Pair Cable`**

-   Two or more pairs of cable twisted together.
-   Color coded wrapped plastic.
-   Pairs are wrapped in another plastic sheath.
-   Will utilize an RJ-45 connector for data.

### T568/A cable
<p align="center"> <img src="https://images.theengineeringprojects.com/image/webp/2018/07/introduction-to-rj45-4.png.webp?ssl=1" height="300" weight="200"/> </p>

> üî¥ The difference between /A and /B is that the first two pin of T-568A 1 and 2 are swapped with pin 3 and 6. 

#### Crossed over ethernet cable

**`IMPORTANT >`** [David Bombal shorts ](https://youtube.com/shorts/XjA-GIS9U5U?feature=share) - Info about cross wired cable on devices.

### STP and UTP cable:
- **Shielded Twisted Pair Cabling** 
	- Copper cabling that has metal foil, or braied sheilding surrounding the paris.
	- Decreases the susceptibility of EMI. 
	- More expensive thatn UTP and can be more difficult to work with. 

- **Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling**
	- UTP does not have any protective metal coating.
	- Very susceptible to EMI.
	- Relatively inexpensive and easy to work with.

### Twisted Pair Cabling Categories:

| Category | Data Rate | Max Length | Application |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| CAT1 | Upto 1 Mbps | | Old Telephone cables. Voice only... Outdated |
| CAT2 | Upto 4 Mbps | | Token Ring, Token based networks only... Outdated |
| Cat3 | 10 Mbps | 100m | Voice Traffic. [TIA/EIA]. Token Ring & 10 Base-T Ethernet |
| CAT4 | 15 Mbps | 100m | Token Ring Networks.Superseded by CAT5. Rarely used today. |
| CAT5 | 100 Mbps | 100m | Fast Ethernet. 100Mhz Frequency.8p8c, RJ45 connector. |
| CAT5e | 1 Gbps | 100m | addressed crosstalk issues. 100Mhz Frequency. |
| CAT6 | 10 Gbps | 100m | Gigabit Ethernet 200-250Mhz. 10Gbps upto 55meter. |
| CAT6a | 10 Gbps | 100m | Augmented CAT6. 500 Mhz. 328 feet. |
| CAT7 | 10 Gbps+ | 100m | 10/100 Base T, GG45, TERA connector. 600Mhz.4 connector. |
| CAT7a | 10 Gbps | 100m | 1/100 Base T. 1000MHz. Additional shielding than cat7. |

#### CAT7  network cable

<p align="center"> <img src="https://stl.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/img4-1.jpg"  height="300" weight="200"/> </p>
Category 7 wire has four shielded twisted copper pairs and an overall cable shield. This helps it meet the strict signal loss over distance criteria and ensures Cat7 cable is better at protecting against possible degradation caused by crosstalk and EMI.

#### Difference between CAT 6 and CAT 7

<p align="center"> <img src="https://www.hdcabling.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CAT5e_vs_CAT6A_vs_CAT7_Differences_in_Construction.jpg" /> </p>
Cat7¬†has a higher frequency than Cat6. As a result, a¬†CAT 7 shielded ethernet cable will be able to transfer data faster than a Cat6 cable.¬†The Cat¬†7 shielded¬†cable¬†performance and longevity criteria are also more stringent.

- Unshielded Twisted pair (UTP)
- Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP) 
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) 
- SFTP (Shielded & Foiled Twisted pair) 
- STP (Screened Shielded Twisted pair)

#### CAT6  variants:

<p align="center"> <img src="https://www.hdcabling.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CAT6_vs_CAT6A_vs_CAT6e_Mhz_Speed_Bandwidth_Diagram-1536x1155.jpg"  height="350"/> </p>

#### CAT 8 cable: 
<p align="center"> <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/tSIAAOSw2Qtc-NHa/s-l1600.jpg"  height="300" weight="200"/> </p>
Category 8, or Cat8, cable, is a type of¬†Ethernet¬†cable¬†that is distinct from other cables. It can operate at a frequency of up to 2 GHz (2000 MHz). This is the main¬†difference between Cat7 and Cat8.¬†Cat 8 ethernet cable¬†is restricted to a 30-meter 2-connector channel. It also necessitates shielded cabling.

- **Entrance Facilities:** Service entrance to the building, the Demarcation Point, and Backbone Connections.
- **Backbone Wiring:** Connection between Communication closet and Equipement rooms. Depends on the media choosen like copper or Fiber.
- **Equipemnt Room:**  Main Cross Connect (**MCC**), point of termination for Backbone wiring. Also considered as Main Distribution Frame(MDF).
- **Telecommunication closet:** Contains the connection equipment for any nearby workstations, as well as conection between communication cross connects.
- **Horizontal Wiring:** The cabling that goes between the workstation and the telecommunication closet.
- **Work Area:** Everything coming from the wall to the workstation. Includes the faceplate, connectors and wiring.

> Demarcation Point is the point at which the responsibility of the network changes from you to ISP.


**The TIA also send out some specification of standards that line out the minimum performance level for network media.**

### 568 /A /B /C standards:

- **568 /A standards -** Older standard for data, voice, and video in commercial buildings. Outdated by 568 /B and /C standards.
- **568 /B standards -** Earlier standards including STP and UTP performance minimums, as well as Fiber Optic standards. Portions are now obsolete, but not completely.
- **568 /C standards -** Current standard minimums for optimizing network media performance in commercial buildings. Specifies CAT6a as the media type recommended.

### Premise Wiring:

### Modular connector

- A type of electrical connector that is commonly used in the following:
	- Telepnone ssytems
	- Data networks 
	- Low-speed serical connections

> Example of Modular connector : 8P8C connector

### Horizontal Cabling

Horizontal cabling wiring can be IW (inside wiring) or plenum calbling and connects telecommunications rooms to individual outlets or work areas on the floor, usually through the wireways, conduits or ceiling spaces of each floor. A horizontal cross-connect is where the horizontal cabling connects to a patch panel or punch up block, which is connected by backbone cabling to the main distribution facility.

### MDI and MDI-X

Devices on an Ethernet computer network use two types of hardware interfaces:
	- MDI
	- MDI-X

#### MDI
- Stands for Medium Dependent Inerface
- A hardware interface that establishes a direct physical and electrical connection with an UTP cable.
- An MDI port is the traditional port on the back of a computer's NIC
- An MDI device is a device with an MDI port 
	- A computer or a laptop

#### MDI-X
- Stands for Medium Dependent Inerface with crossover
- The ports of devices that provide connectivity, such as a switch or a hub, are setup as Media Depenednt Interface with Crossover(MDI-X)
- An MDI-X Device is a device with an MDI-X port
	- Switches or Routers


**`IMPORTANT > `** [Cross over cable - By David Bombal shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XjA-GIS9U5U)

### Straight-through cable

- A type of Ethernet cable used to connect dissimilar devices
	- Example: An UTP cable connecting a computer and a switch
- Also known as patch cable
- UTP cable are used in modern Ethernet network
- The wires of an UTP cable cannot be plugged directly into Computer's NIC or A switch's port
- Pin and wire assignments are in the same order on the both the ends of the cable.

> Example: A computer with a switch

### Crossover Cable

### Rollover Cable

- Used to connect a PC or a laptop directly to the console port of a switch or a router
- Has an 8P8C connector on one end and a RS-232 based connector, such as DB-9 connector, on the other end.
- Cisco console cable is typically used by network administrators to configure a Cisco switch or a Cisco router.
- Pin 1 of an 8P8C connector is connected to Pin 8 of a RS-232 connector, Pin 2 is connected to pin 7, 3 goes to 6, and so on

### Copper Connector 

#### DB Connector

- D connectors created by Cannon in 1952:
	- Used in Token Ring Network
	- External floppy disk drives
	- Mouse connectors
	- Replaced by USB

- D shape: 
	- Ensures cables correctly attached
	- Designed to work with the EIA/TIA 232 serial interface standards
	- DB9(RS-232), DB25


#### F Connector
Coaxial RF connector:
- Commonly used for cable, satellite TV/ Cable modem
- Seen in TV antenna connections
- Usable bandwidth up to several GHz

#### Punch-down Blocks

Typically used for telephony electrical connections:
- Copper wires 'punched down' into open-ended slots
-  66 block is a model number (50 rows)
	- Subject to crosstalk - not suitable for 100 Mbps
- 100 block replaced 66 block
	- Often used to terminate cable runs

#### Fiber Distribution Panel

<p align="center"> <img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/AB/VN/MY-25204275/1-500x500.jpg" /> </p>

AKA fiber distribution hub(FHD):

- Patch panel used to terminate fiber optic cables
- Provides access to the cable's individual fibers for cross connection

### RG standards

Type | Impendence (Ohms) | Shields | Remarks
---- | --- | --- | ---
RG-6U | 75 | Double | Low loss at high frequency for cable television, satellite television and cable modems
RG-6/UQ | 75 | Quad | This is "quad shield RG-6". It has four layers for shielding, regular RG-6 has only one or two.
RG-59/U | 75 | Single | Used to carry baseband video in closed circuit television, Previously used for cable television. In general, it has poor shielding but will carry an HQ HD signal or video over short distances
RG-59A/U | 75 | Single | Similar physical characteristic as RG-59 and RG-59U, but with a higher velocity factor 8.9@700 MHz.

### Transceivers

<p align="center"> <img src="https://cdn.optcore.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fiber-Optical-Transceiver-Series_500.jpg" /> </p>

Transmitter/ Receiver - converts the serial electrical signal to serial optical signals and vice versa: 
- Cisco Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC) is a hot-swappable input/ output device that plugs into  a Gigabit Ethernet port or slot, linking the port with the network.
- Small Form-Factor Pluggable(SFP) Gigabit Interface Converter is a hot-swappable input/output device that plugs into a Gigabit Ethernet port or slot(1 Gbit/s.)
- (SFP+) is an enhanced version of the SFP that supports data rates upto 16 Gbit/s.
- Quad Small Form-factor Pulggable (QSFP)(4x1/10/14/28 Gbit/s.)
